# Data-Cleaning

Data Cleaning is a crutial process in data engineering that focuses on improving the quality and reliabilty of data. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that data is accurate, complete, consistent and in the proper format for analysis and other data related tasks.


**Handling Missing Values**   
Handling missing values refers to the process of addressing and managing data points that are missing or incomplete within a dataset.

**Scaling**  

Scaling refers to the process of applying data transformations to ensure that the values in different features or variables are on similar scale or range.

 **Normalization**  
 
Scaling just changes the range of your data. Normalization is a more radical transformation. The point of normalization is to change the observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution.
